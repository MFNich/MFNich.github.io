## Bloc-Chat
 Bloc-Chat is a simple but effective chat interface. It was made completely utilizing the Angular framework. Its purpose was to display the strengths and possible faults of fully modular code.

 Using Firebase we created a simple database for the chat room interface. It allows you to login a personal username, and create a new room. From there we integrated a simple messaging system which logs your username as well as the appropriate time-stamp with the content of the message.
## Bloc-Jams
 Bloc-Jams is a basic music-player that I created during my apprenticeship. The purpose of its development was to showcase multiple different methods and skills to achieve the same results.

 The most challenging aspect being the actual music-player. We explored a few different options, using Javascript, Jquery, and the Angular framework. Experimenting and reformatting in order to arrive at the most efficient solution.
