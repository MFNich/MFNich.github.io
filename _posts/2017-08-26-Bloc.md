title:  "Bloc so far"

Enrolling in Bloc was a very easy decision for me at the time. I felt strongly about developing the skills they offered, and was ready to drop everything to make it a priority.

That being said, it has proven to be one of the more challenging things I have ever pursued. I am currently only two and half months into the program and I am starting to feel the heat, so to speak. But I also gain a great sense of achievement in even the smallest accomplishments learning to program. Its quite comparable to a roller-coaster considering the pace of the program. I experience very high-high's, as well as low-low's. Once you adjust to that cycle you begin let go of any immediate frustration or overwhelming feelings. Instead you learn to simply take it one step at a time, piece by piece. I feel that this understanding is critical to avoiding self doubt and remaining consistent. If anyone is thinking of learning to code I would recommend leaving expectation behind, and instead looking only at what is in front of you. It is a huge field that is constantly evolving. I know that it will take quite a bit of time become competent, let alone adept at developing software. But I intend to immerse myself fully, and hopefully with the help of my mentor I can continue to further develop my skill-set.
