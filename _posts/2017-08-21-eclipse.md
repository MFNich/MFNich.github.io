Once in a Lifetime!

Amazingly my home was in the center of the path of totality for the eclipse today. As much as our day to day stress and monotony can get the better of us. There is nothing quite like a massive celestial body blocking out our, for lack of a better word, galactic life-line. It is incredibly humbling to have the lights turned out, and to be reminded just how small we are.
